# EEG-Imageined-Speech-Recognition
**COMP499 Final Project: Imagined Speech Recognition Through EEG Signals**

The project focuses on developing a system to convert imagined speech into corresponding text, utilizing brain activity recorded through EEG signals and machine learning algorithms. This technology holds promise for individuals unable to speak, enabling them to execute commands simply by thinking.
To capitalize on recent advancements, the project will utilize either the SpeechBrain or SpeechBrain-MOABB framework. The latter is specifically designed to streamline the development and evaluation of neural networks for various EEG tasks, including motor imagery. 
By efficiently managing tasks such as data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, batching, training/evaluation loops across subjects, multiple seed evaluations, and hyperparameter tuning, SpeechBrain-MOABB allows users to concentrate primarily on designing their neural networks.
